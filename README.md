##About Ludumdare
Ludum Dare is an online community best known for “Ludum Dare”, the Accelerated Game Development Event of the same name (also called a “Game Jam”). During a Ludum Dare, developers from around the world spend a weekend creating games based on a theme suggested by the community. Ludum Dare events take place every April, August and December.

Founded in April 2002 by Geoff Howland, the Ludum Dare community has been running its brand of Game Jam for more than 12 years. It’s both the longest running, and the largest Online Game Jam in the world.

The website is operated and maintained by Mike Kasprzak (PoV). Mike is part of the team that has been bringing you Ludum Dare since the very beginning.
